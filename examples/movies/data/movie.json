The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. \n\nNow in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!\n\nJumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter \u0096 I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. \n\nThe acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. \n\nSo if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 376340, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.1}, "contentRating": "PG", "genre": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Family"], "datePublished": "1995-12-15", "keywords": "board game,    trapped in a game,    adventurer,    fight,    game", "duration": "PT1H44M", "actor": [{"name": "Robin Williams", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/"}, {"name": "Kirsten Dunst", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/"}, {"name": "Bonnie Hunt", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001372/"}], "director": [{"name": "Joe Johnston", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002653/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Jonathan Hensleigh", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378144/"}, {"name": "Greg Taylor", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852430/"}, {"name": "Jim Strain", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833164/"}]}, "3": {"type": "Movie", "name": "Grumpier Old Men", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0113228/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDkwYTZmMDQtOWNhOC00Y2I5LWI0NjQtOTljODBmZjU0NWU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTQzOTYy._V1_.jpg", "description": null, "review": {"author": "planktonrules", "dateCreated": "2021-09-28", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "Not quite as good as the first, but still well worth seeing.", "reviewBody": null, "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 29717, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.6}, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "datePublished": "1995-12-22", "keywords": "sequel,    rivalry,    old man,    second part,    neighbor neighbor relationship", "duration": "PT1H41M", "actor": [{"name": "Walter Matthau", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000527/"}, {"name": "Jack Lemmon", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000493/"}, {"name": "Ann-Margret", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000268/"}], "director": [{"name": "Howard Deutch", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0222043/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Mark Steven Johnson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425756/"}]}, "4": {"type": "Movie", "name": "Waiting to Exhale", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0114885/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDY2YWQtYWJhYy00OGQ2LTk4NzktYWJkNDYwZWJmY2RjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Based on Terry McMillan's novel, this film follows four very different African-American women and their relationships with men.", "review": {"author": "jazp", "dateCreated": "2007-07-02", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "great touching story", "reviewBody": "While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends.

The sets and atmosphere are presented in immaculate detail, and authentic looking, surpassing anything ever portrayed in film other than the Whitehouse itself. I've been in the real Whitehouse, including the Oval Office, and have also sat at the faux Resolute desk on the set of West Wing (same desk used in this film). There was a tremendous investment made to recreate the real thing in this film, and Reiner pulled it off perfectly.\n\nIn Sorkin's screenplays, self-confidence, keen intellect, superior communication ability, and one's ethics-compass are at the core of the protagonist's persona.\n\nMichael Douglas portrays Democratic President Andrew Shepherd with the same believability and deft touch as he did playing Gordon Gecko in Wall Street.\n\nAnnette Benning is the ideal girlfriend of the widowed Shepherd, and engages the audience (and Douglas) in one of her most charming performances.\n\nA first-class supporting actor ensemble are up to the task of portraying Sorkin's crack White House staff, adding immensely to making this film a feel-good romance that is believable and fun.\n\nThe plot doesn't delve deeply into the emotions or feelings of Shepard nor Benning's lobbyist charecter Sydney Ellen Wade, but highlights the witty repertoire one would expect from a US President and Capitol Hill lobbyist. The deft skill and movie-star quality each actor has developed in their respective acting careers are showcased with Sorkin's writing in telling this Whitehouse Cinderella story.\n\nIf the film went deep into emotions, it would have just gotten in the way of a story of a widowed relatively young President falling in love at first sight with Sydney, and the fun of seeing her being thrust into the White House staff and press fish bowl.\n\nThere is a definite Frank Capra influence to the film.\n\nIt all works better than it might seem on paper, and we get to enjoy another Rob Reiner classic: A director whose movie-making style and subject-matter is as diverse as anyone in the business.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 60592, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.8}, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "datePublished": "1995-11-17", "keywords": "president,    politics,    christmas,    dating,    reference to franklin d. roosevelt", "duration": "PT1H54M", "actor": [{"name": "Michael Douglas", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000140/"}, {"name": "Annette Bening", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000906/"}, {"name": "Martin Sheen", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000640/"}], "director": [{"name": "Rob Reiner", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Aaron Sorkin", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/"}]}, "12": {"type": "Movie", "name": "Dracula: Dead and Loving It", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0112896/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQ0ZDFmYzMtZGMyMi00NmYxLWE0MGYtYzM2ZGNhMTE1NTczL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM5ODMxODc@._V1_.jpg", "description": null, "review": {"author": "guerillagorilla", "dateCreated": "2004-07-12", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "The most underrated comedy in my DVD arsenal", "reviewBody": null, "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 45142, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 5.8}, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Comedy", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "datePublished": "1995-12-22", "keywords": "dracula,    vampire,    insane asylum,    jonathan harker character,    mina murray character", "duration": "PT1H28M", "actor": [{"name": "Leslie Nielsen", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000558/"}, {"name": "Mel Brooks", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000316/"}, {"name": "Peter MacNicol", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001493/"}], "director": [{"name": "Mel Brooks", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000316/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Mel Brooks", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000316/"}, {"name": "Rudy De Luca", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0209918/"}, {"name": "Steve Haberman", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352229/"}]}, "13": {"type": "Movie", "name": "Balto", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0112453/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBhNmFlZjMtMzhlYy00NDBlLWFiMjctMmE0ZjgwOGM2MTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjExODE1MDc@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An outcast Husky risks his life with other sled dogs to prevent a deadly epidemic from ravaging Nome, Alaska.", "review": {"author": "Dragondrawer88", "dateCreated": "2005-08-25", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "Awesome review for an awesome movie", "reviewBody": "Balto has been a favorite movie of mine ever since it came out. This is the touching story of an out casted half dog half wolf named Balto voiced by the talented Kevin Bacon who's voice added a slight charm to the Balto character. The story takes place in Nome Alaska in the year 1925. A sickness as stricken the town's children and with out the antitoxin which is located hundreds of miles away in town of Nanana, the children will surly die. The dog team sent to retrieve the medicine which is led by Balto's almost arch nemesis Steel, is lost in a horrible snow storm. Now it is up to Balto to find the missing sled dog team and bring the medicine back to Nome before it is too late.\n\nThis movie is so gripping, I can never sit through the whole thing without balling my eyes out. This movie has a great plot which is based of a true story, a wonderful cast of voice actors, and a vary flowing animation style. This movie is so gripping and compelling that it as inspired me to become an cartoonist. I loved this movie so much that some how I found out I have three copies of it in my movie library. Surly this movie is worth seeing or owning if it makes a 17 year old shows tears for it, or sets the course for his career.

On TV the feeling is the same. The plot is a treasure hunt, but it never really sets the pulses racing or feels like it is a really fun romp or such. Instead the story telling is rather workmanlike without spark or life.\n\nWhat exists in it's place is a lot of noise and energy \u0096 but it is energy that is misdirected and misplaced in this case. The action scenes look very expensive (when a lavish harbour town is destroyed you can see the budget) but the also lack excitement or tension. Instead they are hollow spectacles. I'm not a big fan of Harlin's work. Cliffhanger was OK but Die Hard 2 was the weakest of the series. Here he can't seem to find the excitement in his action \u0096 maybe because some much effort was on the design of effects shots than on reasons for the action.\n\nDavis is OK in the lead role but it is easy to think of a couple of actresses that might have been more convincing playing it tough. Modine has a few lines that suggest his character will be better than he actually is. Despite a few witty moments of banter early on he just becomes a bland character. Langella is OK but only because he has a reasonable screen presence rather than having a great character.\n\nOverall this is dull and not very engaging at all. The action is hollow and the plot/characters have nothing to really grip.

We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters.\n\nMike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other.\n\nThe acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession.\n\nOverall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level.

And yet I still love this unusual time travel tale: it's got great performances, with a particularly strong turn from the then up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and Gilliam's chaotic storytelling actually suits the inherent madness of the whole movie. The twisty-turny plot keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, and Gilliam pulls all the threads together neatly for the finale. The occasional moment of visual excess still niggles (the steampunk/trash-heap aesthetic of the future isn't my cup of tea), but on the whole this is definitely one of the director's best films.\n\nBruce Willis stars as James Cole, a convict from the future who is sent to the past to try and discover the origins of the virus that wiped out most of the world's human population. After a violent altercation with the police of 1990, Cole is sent to an asylum where he meets patient Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), son of a wealthy scientist (played by Christopher Plummer), and quite possibly plants the seeds of mankind's destruction in the lunatic's mind. Together with his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), Cole tries to prevent the disaster from occurring.\n\nAt times, it seems as though Gilliam has only the slightest command of proceedings, and the film demands that the viewer puts in 100% concentration to avoid becoming as lost and confused as Cole himself, who becomes more and more unsure about what is reality and what isn't as the film progresses.

Seeing herself as a matchmaker, Cher first coaxes two teachers into dating each other.", "review": {"author": "Chrysanthepop", "dateCreated": "2008-08-11", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "An Excellent Modern Teen Adaptation Of Austen's 'Emma'", "reviewBody": "Just the other day I watched Heckerling's wonderful romantic comedy satire 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' and I thought I'd revisit 'Clueless'. The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.\n\nThen the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).\n\nAlicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.\n\nFor me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick.

Anthony decides to sign up for service in the US Marines. While there he fights alongside some of his old friends and makes new ones. After four years serving his country he returns home and discovers life isn't easy for a young black man during an economic downturn. He gets a job but it doesn't pay much; his girlfriend, and mother of his child, is getting money from a pimp and his girlfriend's sister is in a radical militant group. When he loses his job he and his friends work with a local criminal to make one big score... to rob an armoured car taking used currency to be incinerated.\n\nWhen I sat down to watch this I was expecting a fairly conventional heist movie; that is certainly what the DVD box implied... in fact that is only a very small part of the film. Rather than the conventional heist movie where the first half is the planning before the execution this is about the events that led a promising young man to turn crime. The early scenes serve to introduce us to Anthony and his friends; he clearly isn't a saint as we see him working for a local crook but he still volunteers and ends up fighting in Vietnam where he sees some very unpleasant things. The scenes set during the war are in turns exciting and disturbing but not entirely without humour. Back in the US the film captures the poverty of Bronx where there are few real opportunities for most people; and while not justifying it explains why some turn to crime or radicalism. When we finally get to the robbery it is well handled; exciting without being glamourous. The cast does a fine job; most notably Larenz Tate who excels as Anthony and Chris Tucker who brings humour to the proceedings, as his friend Skip, without going too far and feeling out of place. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; just don't expect a traditional crime/heist movie.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 24455, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.9}, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "datePublished": "1995-10-06", "keywords": "hood,    vietnam war,    1960s,    black panthers,    war wound", "duration": "PT1H59M", "actor": [{"name": "Larenz Tate", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005478/"}, {"name": "Keith David", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/"}, {"name": "Chris Tucker", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000676/"}], "director": [{"name": "Albert Hughes", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400436/"}, {"name": "Allen Hughes", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400441/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Allen Hughes", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400441/"}, {"name": "Albert Hughes", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400436/"}, {"name": "Michael Henry Brown", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0114285/"}]}, "43": {"type": "Movie", "name": "Restoration", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0114272/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQwODk5ZGItMDk5OS00MjU4LTgyYmUtYTBiMTFhYWM5MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_.jpg", "description": null, "review": {"author": "sampleman411-1", "dateCreated": "2002-05-10", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "The Age of Enlightenment", "reviewBody": null, "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 9915, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.6}, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Biography", "Drama", "History"], "datePublished": "1996-02-02", "keywords": "17th century,    plague,    based on novel,    1660s,    king charles ii", "duration": "PT1H57M", "actor": [{"name": "Robert Downey Jr.", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/"}, {"name": "Sam Neill", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000554/"}, {"name": "David Thewlis", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000667/"}], "director": [{"name": "Michael Hoffman", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001355/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Rose Tremain", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871857/"}, {"name": "Rupert Walters", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910361/"}]}, "45": {"type": "Movie", "name": "To Die For", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0114681/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGQ2ZjIyMGItZDMzZi00ZThkLTlkM2MtNDRhMTNiNWFlMzVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_.jpg", "description": "A beautiful but na\u00efve aspiring television personality films a documentary on teenagers with a darker ulterior motive.", "review": {"author": "safenoe", "dateCreated": "2022-03-07", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "Nicole Kidman's movie", "reviewBody": "Six years after Dead Calm, Nicole Kidman gets serious in To Die For, directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Buck Henry.

I found it to be very charming, with wonderful characters, fantastic animation, stunning visuals, sweet chemistry between the lovers, lovely songs (Colours of the Wind is breathtaking), and simple Disney entertainment. I liked the way it ended, somewhat differently from other Disney films.\n\nMy only complaint is that I didn't like it when one of the Indians got killed and how Pocahontas was more concerned about never seeing John. Also the father forgiving John immediately was unrealistic. More character development was required for us to at least understand the father's character. The dialogues were a little clich\u00e9d. It was also strange to see Pocahontas communicating with John in English.\n\nHaving read about 'Pocahontas' I found it very unfair that it was labelled a racist film. Where was the racism? If anything, it's about bringing people together. It's about unconditional love that can exist both within and between races. I also think it was very unfair that the film was trashed for not being historically accurate. Come on, it's a Disney film for kids not some kind of epic film. Perhaps the unconventional ending (quite non-Disney) was too much to take for some people.\n\nHowever, except for the flaws I mentioned, I think it's a great film and one can really enjoy it especially because of the visual beauty and the beautiful songs and I loved the characters Percy, Meeko and Flit.

Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round. The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.\n\nIt concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea. The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before. That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.\n\nGabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie. Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic. The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man. He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.\n\nDirector Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 1144125, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 8.5}, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery"], "datePublished": "1995-08-16", "keywords": "surprise ending,    criminal mastermind,    criminal,    unreliable narrator,    suspect", "duration": "PT1H46M", "actor": [{"name": "Kevin Spacey", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000228/"}, {"name": "Gabriel Byrne", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000321/"}, {"name": "Chazz Palminteri", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001590/"}], "director": [{"name": "Bryan Singer", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001741/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Christopher McQuarrie", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003160/"}]}, "51": {"type": "Movie", "name": "Guardian Angel", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0109950/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5Mjg4MTU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNTAwNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": null, "review": {"author": "gridoon", "dateCreated": "2007-10-11", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "Slightly above-average Cynthia Rothrock vehicle", "reviewBody": null, "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 522, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 4.9}, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Action", "Drama", "Thriller"], "datePublished": "1994-11-22", "keywords": "murder of a police officer,    shooting a police officer,    police officer,    police officer killed,    police officer shot", "duration": "PT1H37M", "actor": [{"name": "Cynthia Rothrock", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001686/"}, {"name": "Daniel McVicar", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002743/"}, {"name": "Lydie Denier", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219106/"}], "director": [{"name": "Richard W.

George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini.

Also, despite the low budget, the effects were sufficiently good to suspend disbelief. In fact, the attention to detail (surroundings, back-ground, odd gadgets etc.) was excellent, as is important in all sci-fi films...by creating a coherent world, the movie becomes that much more convincing. The performances were excellent, for such a low budget, and some of the lines were very quotable (up there with the script of 'Aliens' if you ask me). This is always an advantage.

He`s not flawless of course and his flaws are plain to see in his later film THE PLEDGE but I found THE CROSSING GUARD to be both very moody and very moving with some truly great acting on display . It does suffer from one deep flaw - Penn`s script \n\nThe problem is how the two protagonists are written . Freddy Gales daughter is killed by drunk driver John Booth so guess which character THE CROSSING GUARD portrays in a sympathetic light ? That`s right , the one who killed the girl ! I won`t go as far to say that Penn has painted Booth as the real victim , but why on earth does he paint Freddy as being such a harsh character ? He`s vulgar , always in a drunken state and when it comes to women his attitude is disgusting , in fact he`s a dirty old man and there`s nothing to prove it`s caused by the reaction to the death of his daughter . He is the opposite of Booth who is shown as a different character whose spell in prison has changed him into a profound man able to contribute to society . I see so the man bereaved by the criminal is actually the bad guy ?

As a response to the undeniable oppression, the black community of Glen Allen, Mississippi, bonded and supported one another. It did, in fact, mean that their lives were made less miserable. They experienced joy and fellowship as well as oppression. They refused to take on victim-hood as an identity. At the same time, there was a vigorous challenge to the status quo.

White Squall is something of a let down in comparison, but it certainly deserved more than a measly $10 million US gross at the box office. As you would expect from a Scott film it boasts his trademark lavish production quality and stunning photography. The sequences at sea at some of the most spectacular ever filmed as Scott revels in the rolling waves and lurching ship, convey the ferociousness at sea, even in fairly calm conditions like no other film I can recall. The story however is less successful and is essentially (and unusually unoriginal for a Scott movie) a Dead Poets' Society at sea, as a motley crew of young boys, played by a talented and convincing set youngsters, do a lot of growing during the course of the voyage under the watchful eye of an Ahab-esque but eventually sympathetic Jeff Bridges. The final scene most definitely resembles that of Dead Poets' Society. (Captain. My Captain).

Again Thandie Newton as the slave girl Analeese is okay, but the character is very two dimensional.

You're drawn in by director Nick Broomfield's smooth and ever-so-earnest British-style interviewing techniques while forgetting that he's talking to extremely unpleasant and even odious people (including Heidi Fleiss herself).\n\nThis Hollywood madam was apparently at the top of the heap in her 'profession,' and it's a tribute to her manipulative skills (I guess) that she was able to do it. She must also be a terrific actor: she looks at times like a wounded little girl, so it's hard to imagine how she was able to reach the 'top,' if that's the word. That's one of the keys to this woman's character, it seems to me: she is such a sleazy opportunist that she seems capable of talking herself into, or out of, anything. If this is true (and the evidence in this film would indicate that), how or why would we believe ANYTHING she says, including her more-or-less 'confessional' at the end? This is a hard-core, professional liar at work.\n\nFleiss is just one of a cast of people in this film who deliberately and systematically deceive each other, so much so that they have lost touch with what is, or isn't, truth. They no longer know where the line of truth is, and their own glaring self-deception is evident in Broomfield's camera. \n\nYou're left quite exhausted by the talking heads, and you realize that the documentary has little redeeming value -- we don't know anything more about who these characters REALLY ARE than when the film started.\n\nIn short, everyone is lying here, everyone is driving the viewer down a very convoluted series of rhetorical streets, everyone is playing that famous 'blame game'. What this film needs is some kind of resolution, some denouement. We don't get one, but we still watch. It's interesting to observe ourselves being manipulated by professional liars, and also interesting to see that director Broomfield emerges as a pretty nifty manipulator himself.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 838, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.6}, "contentRating": "Not Rated", "genre": ["Documentary", "Biography"], "datePublished": "1995-12-27", "keywords": "narration,    prostitution,    character name in title", "duration": "PT1H46M", "actor": [{"name": "Nick Broomfield", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112374/"}, {"name": "Nina Xining Zuo", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3189486/"}, {"name": "Madam Alex", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0018208/"}], "director": [{"name": "Nick Broomfield", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112374/"}], "creator": []}, "100": {"type": "Movie", "name": "City Hall", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/tt0115907/", "poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMGEwNDAtZGVjYS00NWIyLWI4NGQtZGYzMjA0YzIzZGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzMDUzNTI3._V1_.jpg", "description": "The accidental shooting of a boy in New York leads to an investigation by the Deputy Mayor, and unexpectedly far-reaching consequences.", "review": {"author": "pivko", "dateCreated": "2002-01-23", "inLanguage": "English", "heading": "Intelligent political thriller not pretending anything", "reviewBody": "Well, there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller.

His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 22427, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.2}, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery"], "datePublished": "1996-02-16", "keywords": "columbia tristar,    trailer,    tv spot,    columbia tristar home video,    sony", "duration": "PT1H51M", "actor": [{"name": "Al Pacino", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/"}, {"name": "John Cusack", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/"}, {"name": "Bridget Fonda", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000403/"}], "director": [{"name": "Harold Becker", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000887/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Ken Lipper", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0513601/"}, {"name": "Paul Schrader", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001707/"}, {"name": "Nicholas Pileggi", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683380/"}]}}
